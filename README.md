Starter Web Development Kit
===========================

This is a Starter Kit to develop a website using last technologies.

## Design

* [HTML5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com); the now standard HTML5 boilerplate,
* [compass](http://compass-style.org); a [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) environment to develop web pages.
  You will need the [less compass plugin](http://github.com/willhw/compass-less-plugin). 

## Generating content

* [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org); a static website generator
* Many of my personal multi language blog environment scripts and libraries.
